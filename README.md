## Overview

This repo is an experimental agent-based workflow designed to search for disease-causing variants in a patient's genomic sequencing results based on a description of the patient's symptoms. 

See my blog post, [Can an AI agent help diagnose genetic diseases?](https://jeffjjohnston.github.io/2025/07/20/genomics-ai-agent/) for additional discussion.
